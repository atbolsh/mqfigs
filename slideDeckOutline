FUNCTIONS FOR DAMPED DRIVEN OSCILLATOR

A, Phi, ground truth

A, Phi logspace

peak_broad summary

center_very_broad param3

complete failure graph

logspace performed better - logspace_broad

logspace_peak_narrow shows last, fascinating failure mode: param2 vs predictions

(logspace_peak_narrow modelA?)
